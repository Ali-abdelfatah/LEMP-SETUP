# LEMP Stack Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture for the LEMP stack deployed in this project. The setup includes Linux, Nginx, MariaDB, and PHP, optimized for high availability and load balancing to support WordPress hosting.

## 2. Components
- **Linux (CentOS)**: The operating system managing all services.
- **Nginx**: Web server acting as a reverse proxy for traffic distribution and load balancing.
- **MariaDB**: Relational database system configured with master-slave replication for redundancy.
- **PHP-FPM**: PHP processor for handling dynamic content generated by WordPress.


## 3. Load Balancing
Two Nginx servers are deployed with Keepalived to provide high availability. Traffic is evenly distributed to backend servers using reverse proxy and load balancing.

- **Keepalived**: Ensures failover between Nginx servers by using Virtual IP addresses (VIP).
- **Reverse Proxy**: Requests from clients are forwarded to available backend WordPress instances.

## 4. Database Replication
MariaDB is configured with a master-slave replication setup.
- **Master**: Primary database that handles all write operations.
- **Slave**: Read replica for load distribution and redundancy.
The replication ensures high availability and consistency between servers.

## 5. High Availability (HA)
- **Keepalived**: Provides redundancy for the Nginx servers by automatically promoting a backup server in case of failure.
- **Database Failover**: Automatic switching between master and slave databases.

## 6. Security Considerations
- Firewalls are configured to allow only necessary traffic.
